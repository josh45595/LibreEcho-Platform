# LibreEcho MT8163 OTA contract

## Platform mapping

The Biscuit Amonet layout has two layers of boot storage:

| BCB slot | Amonet entry/wrapper | Redirected OS image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | `boot_a`, `/dev/mmcblk0p17`, 225280 sectors | `boot_a_x`, `/dev/mmcblk0p10`, 32768 sectors |
| B | `boot_b`, `/dev/mmcblk0p18`, 225280 sectors | `boot_b_x`, `/dev/mmcblk0p11`, 32768 sectors |

Amonet hooks LK reads of `boot_a` and `boot_b` and redirects the Android boot
image reads to the corresponding `_x` partition. It also redirects normal
fastboot `flash boot_a`/`flash boot_b` commands to `_x`. Linux does not pass
through that fastboot hook, so the on-device updater must write `_x` directly.
The large `boot_a` and `boot_b` partitions contain the Amonet header and tail
payload and are read-only invariants for OTA.

The Amazon BCB is 7 bytes at offset `0x360` in `misc`
(`/dev/mmcblk0p8`, 1025 sectors):

```text
zero, "ABB", version,
A(priority:4, tries:3, successful:1),
B(priority:4, tries:3, successful:1)
```

The preloader selects the highest-priority slot that is successful or still
has tries. Before activating an update, the running slot is recorded as
`priority=14, tries=0, successful=1`; the target becomes
`priority=15, tries=3, successful=0`. A healthy target is confirmed as
`priority=15, tries=0, successful=1`. If all target attempts fail, the
preloader falls back to the successful priority-14 slot.

## Write allowlist

An ordinary OTA transaction may write only:

1. the inactive redirected image store, `boot_a_x` or `boot_b_x`;
2. the single 512-byte `misc` sector containing the BCB; and
3. `/data/libreecho/update`, which holds downloaded packages and transaction
   state on the existing `userdata` filesystem.

It must never write or format `boot_a`, `boot_b`, `persist`, `userdata`,
`lk_a`, `lk_b`, either TEE partition, recovery, cache, GPT, RPMB, or
the eMMC boot areas. User configuration remains under
`/data/libreecho/config`; IDME, calibration, MAC addresses, and identity remain
in `persist` and the eMMC boot areas.

There is one bounded migration exception for an installation launched from an
old development image. If, and only if, `expdb` has its exact expected
partition identity and begins with `FASTBOOT_PLEASE`, the installer preserves
the first sector, clears those 15 marker bytes, syncs, and verifies the complete
sector. No other `expdb` content is changed. OTA-profile images do not write
the marker again.

## Signed bundle v1

The transport is a deterministic POSIX tar with these exact members:

```text
manifest
manifest.sig
boot.img
```

`manifest.sig` is a lowercase hexadecimal Ed25519 signature over the exact
manifest bytes. The release public key is embedded in the boot image. The
manifest identifies the board, SoC, ARM architecture, version, boot image size,
SHA-256 digest, and required `image_profile=ota`. Version 1 deliberately updates the boot image only;
persistent feature squashfs payloads and all configuration remain unchanged.
The signed `feature_policy` is immutable across installation. `preserve` means
the private five-payload graph; `community-noncommercial` means the public
five-payload graph with the separately licensed CC-BY-NC-SA wakeword model;
`redistributable` means the commercially unrestricted public production graph
with AirPlay, STT, TTS, and assistant present and wakeword absent; `exclude`
remains the diagnostic payload-free graph.

### Optional owner signing authority

An owner build may add a second Ed25519 public key with
`--ota-owner-public-key`. The maintainer key remains embedded at
`/etc/libreecho/ota-public-key.hex`; it is never replaced by the owner key. The
owner key is embedded separately and, after a package has passed signature and
manifest validation, is atomically seeded to
`/data/libreecho/config/ota-owner-public-key.hex` before any boot partition
write. A different persistent key is rejected rather than silently rotated.

The updater accepts a package when its manifest signature verifies under the
maintainer key or the owner key and records the selected signing authority in
the update transaction. Unknown signers and malformed keys remain rejected.
The persistent owner key survives normal A/B updates because userdata is not an
OTA write target. An exact maintainer image that predates this multi-authority
logic will retain the key bytes in userdata but will not consult them; continuous
owner authority across maintainer releases therefore requires the installed
release to retain this updater capability.

### Preserved payload identity and acceptance boundary

The `preserve` policy retains the existing feature payloads under
`/data/libreecho/features/<feature>/` while an OTA transaction replaces only the
inactive boot image. A successful boot, signature check, or `bootctl confirm`
therefore does **not** prove that the running feature daemons came from the
candidate that supplied the boot image; a candidate can be a deliberate hybrid
until its payload identities are separately reconciled.

`libreecho-update status` reports the effective on-device identity for each
feature (`airplay2`, `tts`, `wakeword`, `stt`, and `assistant`): the persisted
`squashfs` SHA-256 and size, the persisted feature-manifest SHA-256, and the
SHA-256 of the running daemon executable when its process is present. Missing
payloads are reported as `effective=missing`; a stopped daemon is reported as
`running_daemon_sha256=not-running`. These fields are diagnostic evidence, not
an automatic claim that the candidate and runtime match.

The release/publisher gate must compare the candidate's payload and feature
manifest identities against the identities inherited by a `preserve` candidate.
Runtime acceptance must also compare each `running_daemon_sha256` against the
corresponding candidate file hash, or record an explicit waiver. A mismatch
must fail acceptance rather than being silently hidden by the boot-image version.
A future payload-refresh transaction may replace this preserve-only boundary, but
it must preserve models/configuration atomically and verify a rollback-safe
post-apply hash before changing the policy.

For OTA v1, the preserve policy is fail-closed rather than an implicit hybrid:
the signed manifest carries payload, feature-manifest, and supervised-daemon
hashes for all five retained features. The on-device installer compares those
identities, including each running `/proc/<pid>/exe`, before writing the
inactive boot payload and rejects a missing, stopped, or mismatched daemon.
The expected identities are also copied into the persistent `pending`
transaction at `UPDATE_READY`; confirmation rereads those values and repeats
the checks immediately before `bootctl confirm`, so a feature staging operation
between reboot boundaries cannot silently produce a hybrid. A mismatch leaves
the slot unconfirmed and therefore rollback-eligible. This does not refresh
payloads or models; it prevents a candidate from being installed or confirmed
when preserve would leave a different runtime behind.

Manual browser upload streams the tar to `/data/libreecho/update/incoming` and
invokes the target installer. OTA-profile images also check the stable public
GitHub Release asset in `aslater3/LibreEcho`, configured in
`/etc/libreecho/ota-source.conf`. The
fetcher mounts the root-owned assistant feature payload read-only, verifies it
against its staged manifest, and uses its pinned curl and CA bundle. It then
passes the downloaded tar to the same installer; it never implements a second
flashing path. The background watcher checks for a release but does not install
it by default. Users can install an available release explicitly in the system
UI or opt in to automatic installation; automatic installation never forces an
unattended reboot. The opt-in is stored as
`/data/libreecho/update/automatic-updates` and is disabled when that file is
absent. No transport is allowed to bypass
signature, member-list, image-format, partition-identity, inactive-slot,
copy-hash, or BCB readback checks.

Release builds run through the **Build and release LibreEcho OTA** GitHub
Actions workflow. A GitHub-hosted job first runs the complete Kernel recovery
contract and LibreEcho-UI test suites. A runner carrying the
`libreecho-ota-builder` label then uses the locally provisioned, hash-pinned
pipeline inputs to build the exact selected Kernel and UI commits, runs the
canonical independent image verifier, and uploads only the verified 16 MiB
image and provenance.

Signing remains isolated in the `production-signing` environment. That job
revalidates the artifact digest, manifest, source identities, and public-key
pin before environment approval exposes `OTA_SIGNING_KEY_HEX`. It constructs
the deterministic tar, independently verifies its exact members and Ed25519
signature, and uploads the image, manifest, verification log, provenance,
signed stable asset, and checksum to a draft release in `aslater3/LibreEcho`.
Publishing is a separate
step that runs only after a push to protected `main` passes every preceding
job and receives production-signing approval. Branch pushes run source checks
only. The repository variable `LIBREECHO_PIPELINE_ROOT` must point at the
canonical pipeline on the labeled builder. The repository secret
`UI_REPOSITORY_TOKEN` must be a fine-grained token with read-only Contents
access to the private `aslater3/LibreEcho-UI` repository. The build always
forces GitHub signing mode and never reads a local signing key; only the
protected hosted signing job receives `OTA_SIGNING_KEY_HEX`. The
`RELEASE_REPOSITORY_TOKEN` secret must be a fine-grained token with Contents
read/write access to `aslater3/LibreEcho`; it is used only to create and publish
the release there.

The self-hosted build and protected release jobs are disabled unless the
repository variable `ENABLE_SELF_HOSTED_OTA` is exactly `true`. Until a
dedicated runner is provisioned, Kernel and UI branch checks run independently
in their respective private repositories and main merges do not queue a build.

## Development marker

The current development image writes `FASTBOOT_PLEASE` to `expdb` and resets
the BCB to seven tries on every boot. Both behaviors defeat OTA selection and
rollback. They remain available only in an explicit development build profile.
A release/OTA image does not write `expdb` automatically and does not reset the
BCB. An explicit operator request to reboot to fastboot may still write the
marker after validating the `expdb` identity.
